# Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a project that uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. The prediction is based on various information about the passengers and their location on the Titanic.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains demographic and travel information for each passenger on the Titanic.

## Survival Prediction
The survival prediction is based on various factors such as the passengerâ€™s age, sex, passenger class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket fare, and where the passenger embarked from. The model takes these factors into account to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

## How to Use
Clone this repository. Run the Python script on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Please note that this project is finished. Even though contributions and suggestions are welcome!
